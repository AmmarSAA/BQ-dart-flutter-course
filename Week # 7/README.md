### What we have learned

- Learned about different widgets like Scaffold, Text, Container, Row and Column.
- In-depth knowledge of Row and Column in layouts and the difference between them.
- Assign a challenge to students to design a Chess Board


#### Scaffold Widget

The Scaffold widget helps to layout the structure of the screen visually in Material Design and allows us to show appbar, floating buttons, drawers, bottom sheets, etc.

#### Text Widget

The Text widget helps to display text data on the screen. We can also style and decorate the text using the style property in the Text widget.

#### Row Widget

Row allows us to arrange multiple widgets horizontally on the screen. The direction of widget placement in the Row is left to right.

#### Column WIdget

Column allows us to arrange multiple widgets vertically on the screen. The direction of widget placement in the Row is top to bottom.
